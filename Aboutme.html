		<h1>About Me</h1>
		<h3>
			Hi, my name is Jan Ronnel R. De Lara, and I’m a computer engineering student passionate about technology,
			problem-solving, and innovation. My studies focus on the intersection of hardware and software, including
			areas like embedded systems, programming, networking, and circuit design.<hr/>

			I love exploring cutting-edge fields such as artificial intelligence, robotics, and the Internet of Things (IoT).
			Beyond academics, I enjoy working on personal projects, tinkering with hardware, and coding applications that solve
			real-world problems.<hr/>

			When I’m not studying or building something, you’ll probably find me gaming, reading about new tech trends, or experimenting
			with gadgets. My ultimate goal is to design systems and solutions that positively impact the world while staying at the forefront
			of technological advancements.<hr/>

			Let’s connect and collaborate on exciting projects!
